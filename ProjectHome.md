ModelView is a 3D model viewing application for android. It currently supports the standard .off and .obj (partial) file formats. It comes packaged with a library of interesting 3D models and can read user-added models from the device's external storage.

This is a sample application. It has no real purpose other than to occupy my time and teach me a little OpenGL.
